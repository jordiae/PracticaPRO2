1 In a 30k organization, lots of people go on vacay, and some of them (let's say 20) remembered to set their email to auto-respond about their absence.
2 And the auto-responders responded to the same recipients - including all-employees@org.edu.
3 So, every "I don't care about your apartment" message didn't just generate 30,000 copies of itself.
4 That wasn't the real problem.
5 That incident might've simmered down after people stopped responding.
6 The IT staff busied themselves with mucking out the mailboxes from these millions of messages and deactivating the auto-responders.
7 They brought the email system back online, and their first order of business was to send out an email explaining the cause of the problem, etc.
8 And they addressed the notification email.
9 Before they sent their email message, they had disabled most of the auto-responders - but they missed at least one.
10 they missed at least two.
11 This the greatest punchline this story could have.
12 If you need help with anything administrative, please contact Bob.
13 If Bob is unavailable, please have your message printed and put on my desk for when I get back.
